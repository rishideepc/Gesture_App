# Gesture_App
Welcome to my Gesture App!

This is a user-experience application that allows people to control the volume of their devices, with hand gestures only!

The app is made in the Python Kivy framework, and uses modules like openCv, mediapipe, numpy, and os modules to work with the volumes.
