# Gesture_App
Welcome to my Gesture App!

This is a user-experience application that allows people to control the volume of their devices, with hand gestures only!

The cross-platform app is made in the Python Kivy framework, and uses modules like OpenCv, Mediapipe, Numpy, and OS modules to work with the volumes of the device.
